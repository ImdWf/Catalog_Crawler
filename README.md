# Catalog_Crawler
Crawl a list of links and download the regex defined links

This tool was created to dowload a list of newspaper pages from an online archive (Chronic America), but can be used to crawl any link list.
It comes with absolutely no warranty as it just used for a term paper to inquire the historic sources for this paper.
It's written in Python 2.7.

The starting point for a modification is the file chronam.py, from there just follow the imports.
Please note that all functions are labeled in German!
